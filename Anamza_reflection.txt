Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, 
particularly content associated with publishable work. 
Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think 
non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and 
bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study
I am currently switching from word to nano and trying to do everythin in text editor. So down the line there is no issue of imcompatability and 
wanna getting in habit of using text editor. Basically if the reserach is not 
reproduceable then the information is not usable.

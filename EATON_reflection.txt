I currently have only worked on code for one project that is in the process of being published. Before taking this class, I thought I had done a relatively good job of making a bash script that details the analysis pipeline I used, but after learning more about scripting, I have come to realize that my script is not nearly as user-friendly as it could be. While I do think you could successfully subject it to a reproducibility test, it would likely be both difficult and time-consuming. I think non-reproducible research is much more common than you would think. Especially as an evolutionary biologist, it is critical to have reproducible research. However, I think that many scientists like to "cut corners" when making their data and code publicly available, leading to a so-called epidemic of non-reproducible science.
